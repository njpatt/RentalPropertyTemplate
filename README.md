# RentalPropertyTemplate

## Template to be used to showcase rental properties specifically for airbnb. 
The goal of this template is to provide a simple yet useful website to be used for displaying a single rental property and it's appeal.
Currently this is only stable on a desktop web browser, however I plan to revamp the site into a more mobile friendly version at a later date. 

Features and roadmap: 
-Carousel landing page(Finished)
-About page with google maps and landmarks (TODO)
-Image gallery with filter sorting(Need to Finish) 
-Blog page to share local experiences/activities near the property (TODO)
